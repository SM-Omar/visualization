# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      1. Good Data Visualization Example
      https://datavizproject.com/data-type/heat-map/
      Heat Map
      A heat map is a data visualization technique that displays individual values within a matrix
      using variations in color intensity. This method is particularly effective for highlighting
      patterns, correlations, and anomalies across multiple variables.

      Evaluation:
      1. Clarity and Readability: By using colour gradients, heat maps allow viewers to quickly identify high and low concentrations of data, facilitating immediate comprehension.
      2. Effective Use of Colour: The application of colour intensity directly correlates with data
      values, making it intuitive to discern variations without additional explanations.
      3. Pattern Recognition: Heat maps excel at revealing patterns, such as clusters or gaps in data, which might be less apparent in other chart types.

      2. Bad Data Visualization Example
      https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fiona.gordon/viz/AndyKirkCourseWorstVizEver/UgliestDashboardWorstDesign
      Andy Kirk's "Worst Viz Ever"
      This visualization was intentionally designed to demonstrate poor design choices, featuring
      bad color schemes and the use of a bubble chart, which is often criticized for its
      inefficiency in accurately conveying data.

      Evaluation:
      1. Poor Colour Choices: The use of clashing or non-intuitive colours can confuse viewers and
      detract from the data's message.
      2. Ineffective Chart Type: Bubble charts can be challenging to interpret due to difficulties
      in comparing area sizes accurately, leading to potential misinterpretations.
      3. Lack of Accessibility: Poor design choices can make the visualization less accessible to
      individuals with colour vision deficiencies or other visual impairments.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
      A. Good Example: Heat Map
      Even though the heat map is an effective visualization tool, there are still ways to enhance
      its clarity and usability such as:
      1. Use a Clear Colour Scale
        Some heat maps use overly bright or extreme colour gradients that may be difficult to
      interpret.
      2. Include a Legend and Annotations
        Some heat maps lack clear legends, which makes it harder for viewers to interpret values.
        Adding data labels could provide more context.
      3. Ensure Accessibility
        People with colour blindness may struggle to distinguish certain colours.
        A potential fix is to use colour-blind-friendly palettes (e.g., ColorBrewer schemes) or
      provide an alternative view, such as numerical values overlaid on cells.

      B. Bad Example: "Worst Viz Ever"
      This visualization is intentionally bad, but if we were to improve it, hereâ€™s how:
      1. Use a More Effective Chart Type
        Instead of a bubble chart which makes size comparisons difficult, a bar chart or line chart
      could present the data more clearly.
      2. Improve Colour Choices
        The current design has clashing or overwhelming colours. Using subtle, meaningful colour
      contrasts instead of random bright colours would make the data easier to read.
      3. Reduce Clutter and Improve Readability
        The visualization currently has too many elements competing for attention.
        Simplifying the layout and removing unnecessary decorations (chartjunk) would improve
      clarity.
      4. Enhance Labeling and Context
        Some elements lack clear labels, making it harder to understand the chart. Using concise
      titles, axis labels, and explanatory text would help guide viewers.

      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
